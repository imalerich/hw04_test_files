# hw04_test_files

Assorted sound files to test special cases of coms 327 homework 4.
Files are sorted by file format, and then further into groups
based on whether or not they are valid and what they test 
(ie. Header vs Data).

Explanations of what I am trying to test are available as comments
in each .cs229 files. For binary formats I will probably include
an additional text file detailing what the file contains.
