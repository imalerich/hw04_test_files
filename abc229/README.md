# Notes on my abc test files
In order to get some of the songs working properly I have added support for a few
things that were not described in the original documentation.

1)	"Octave" instrument option
	default = 0
	modifies the octave of every note played by the instrument
	
2)	Note length floating point support
	needed for tripelets and other 'weirder' rhythms
